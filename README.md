Maybe i am an *ordinary* person now but i wont be the  same later  
I always tried to be someone but **NOT** anymore  
its not easy to understand me at first but neitheris CODING  
DONT think u understand me *i am **deeper** than the ocean*  

*-**Growing Up Too Fast**-*


It seems for the future I am prepared,  
but the thought of commitment is getting me scared.  
These feelings I feel, they're different, they're new...  
being loved and adored is the reason my confidence grew.  
I feel like his love is helping me cope,  
I'm worried if he leaves me I can't stand on my own.  
I'm forgetting my family, the child I used to be...  
hurting them by fighting for the one I want to see.  
Taking bigger steps every chance I get  
is making me worry that I'll look back with regret.  
Young by age, matured in the mind...  
the little girl they want back is hard to find.

*_**True Friendship - Poem by William S. Tsoukalas, Sr.**_*
 
The feeling of friendship from the start  
Is that special feeling in your heart  
A feeling from deep down inside  
A feeling that no one should hide  
A friend is there through good and bad  
They make you happy when you're sad  
they brighten up your darkest day  
Just by the simple thing's they say  
Now friendship can't be bought or sold  
It may get tarnished, and may get old  
You can over come your greatest fear  
Just look around and it is there  
Now friendship's one and only cost  
Is to make sure that it's never lost

*_**Family Unique**_*

Did you know that our family is unique?  
At the dinner table, good luck if you speak.   
I'm not saying they are bad,  
On occasions they make me mad.  

Maybe our family came from the zoo,  
They really do, have more than one view.  
I'm not here to lay the blame,  
Seems like they're always playing a game.  

Without them, life would be boring,  
Silent nights, no more snoring.  
What can I say, our family is unique,  
I might need a break, just for a week.

*Poetry* (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.  
A *poem* is a piece of writing in which the words are chosen for their beauty and sound and are carefully arranged, often in short lines which rhyme.  
YOU CAN ALSO MAKE POEMS LIKE THESE BY JUST FOLLOWING FEW STEPS ::  

+ If you are writing a poem because you want to capture a feeling that you experienced, then you don’t need these tips. Just write whatever feels right. Only you experienced the feeling that you want to express, so only you will know whether your poem succeeds.(like how i did in the begining ,no rhyme just my feelings)  

+ If, however, your goal is to communicate with a reader — drawing on the established conventions of a literary genre (conventions that will be familiar to the experienced reader) to generate an emotional response in your reader — then simply writing what feels right to you won’t be enough.  
These tips will help you make an important transition:  

+ away from writing poetry to celebrate, commemorate, or capture your own feelings (in which case you, the poet, are the center of the poem’s universe)  
+ towards writing poetry in order to generate feelings in your reader (in which case the poem exists entirely to serve the reader).
